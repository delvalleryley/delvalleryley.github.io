### CPSC 120
 
 * Lab 1 
  
    One of my favorite labs is Lab 01, Part 1. This lab holds a special place for me as it was the first-ever session that introduced me to the basics of coding and GitHub. The teachings from Lab 01 instilled confidence in my coding abilities, serving as the foundation for my subsequent skill development.

* Lab 7

    Another lab that I hold dear is Lab 07, Part 2. This particular session resonates with me because it revolves around poker, a card game I thoroughly enjoy playing with my family. Engaging with a topic I love adds an extra layer of enjoyment and interest to the learning experience, making Lab 07 a memorable and enjoyable part of my educational journey.

* Lab 12

    Lastly, Lab 12, Part 1, stands out as another favorite of mine. Lab 12's appeal lies in its exploration of pictures, gifs, and animations â€“ topics that captivate me. I have always been curious about how gifs and animations operate, and through Lab 12, I have gained a personal understanding of the fascinating process of pixels moving around to create captivating visual effects.
